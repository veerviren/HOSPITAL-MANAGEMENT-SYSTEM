Hospital Management System is a project made with language C++ and uses TUI(called as Terminal User Interface).

The project's capabilities include registration of patients, storing their details into the system, maintaining the doctor database and providing information regarding bed availability in the hospital which has a capacity of 1000 beds. Also the project will generate a unique id for every patient and doctor which is useful for easy retrieval of the details of every patient and doctor. It includes a facility to check the current status of each database. Users can search availability of beds and check for the availability of a doctor under a particular medical department. Few departments which my project includes are :

1. Physician
2. Neurology
3. Oncology
4. Haematology
5. Gastroenterology
6. Gynaecology

In this project I've used OOPS concept along with data file handling.
